ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, my name is Lorenzo Macchiavelli and I am a teacher and student of the Feldenkrais Method. I have also been working in the IT field for 22 years. I have always been curious and I like to understand the world around me from various aspects. I enjoy art, working with ceramics and watercolor painting.
